## Description

Since 2014, when NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) where first created, they have raised a lot of attention. As of 2022, it is safe to say that one of the most well-known NFT marketplaces is [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) and this project attempts to show a very simplified version of it, where users can mint a token by uploading an image file, which will be hosted on IPFS and minted as an ERC-721 Token Standard (NFT) available for sale.

## Technologies used:

- Solidity
- Hardhat
- Web3.js
- Next JS
- Tailwind
- Infura endpoint
- IPFS
- Ethereum blockchain
